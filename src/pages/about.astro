					<h3>Hey, I'm Parkis. Thanks for stopping by.</h3>
					<p class="my-2">
						You could say I'm a Philosophy bachelor who genuinely loves tech. I
						started my journey as a System and Network Admin, getting my hands
						dirty with tools like Mikrotik and Unifi. These days, I've swapped
						that for the world of Business Intelligence and Analytics.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4">How I Stumbled into Data</h3>
					<p>
						I used to be a web developer, managing Linux servers and doing SEO
						for WordPress sites. While I was in the weeds of digital marketing,
						I found the analytics side of things. It was the first time I saw
						how the things I built were actually being measured, and honestly,
						it was a lightbulb moment for me.
					</p>
					<p>
						Seeing the dashboards in Google Analytics and on my own server
						completely changed my perspective. It helped us make a tough call:
						to shut down our own website. We realized the PHP and WordPress
						setup was a huge resource hog, and most of our customers were
						finding us on Instagram and Facebook anyway. It taught me something
						important: whatever I build, it has to actually matter and make a
						real impact.
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4">My Journey and Go-To Tools</h3>
					<p>
						After that, I was hooked. I jumped headfirst into Business
						Intelligence. I realized it's not just about charts and numbers—it's
						about understanding the story behind the data through things like
						Data Modeling and building Data Pipelines.
					</p>
					<p>
						While my main focus is on analytics, I do enjoy coding for data
						pipelines and transformations. I'm really into serverless and
						low-code solutions right now. Here are some of the tools I use
						regularly:
					</p>
					<p class="my-2">
						<strong>Coding:</strong> Python, Astro, Svelte<br />
						<strong>Productivity & BI:</strong> Google Workspace, AppSheet, QField,
						QGIS<br />
						<strong>Platforms:</strong> Cloudflare, SQLite, Geopackage
					</p>

					<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4">What I Do</h3>
					<p>
						So that's what I do now! I help people and businesses make better
						decisions by:
					</p>
					<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
						<li class="my-2">
							Figuring out the right data to track based on what they want to
							achieve.
						</li>
						<li class="my-2">
							Pulling that data together from all the different places it lives.
						</li>
						<li class="my-2">
							Setting up smart and simple ways to collect data with tools like
							AppSheet and QField.
						</li>
						<li class="my-2">
							Turning raw data into insights and ideas for improvement with
							dashboards and reports.
						</li>
					</ul>
