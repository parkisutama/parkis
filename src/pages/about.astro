				<h3>Hey, I'm Parkis. Thanks for stopping by.</h3>
				<p class="my-2">
					You could say I'm a philosopher who genuinely loves tech. I started my
					journey as a System and Network Admin, getting my hands dirty with
					tools like Mikrotik and Unifi. These days, I've swapped that for the
					world of Business Intelligence and Analytics.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4">How I Stumbled into Data</h3>
				<p>
					I used to be a web developer, managing Linux servers and doing SEO for
					WordPress sites. While I was in the weeds of digital marketing, I
					found the analytics side of things. It was the first time I saw how
					the things I built were actually being measured, and honestly, it was
					a lightbulb moment for me.
				</p>
				<p>
					Seeing the dashboards in Google Analytics and on my own server
					completely changed my perspective. It helped us make a tough call: to
					shut down our own website. We realized the PHP and WordPress setup was
					a huge resource hog, and most of our customers were finding us on
					Instagram and Facebook anyway. It taught me something important:
					whatever I build, it has to actually matter and make a real impact.
				</p>

				<h3 class="text-xl font-semibold my-4">
					My Journey into BI and Analytics
				</h3>
				<p>
					After that, I was hooked. I jumped headfirst into Business
					Intelligence. I realized it's not just about charts and numbers; it's
					about understanding the story behind the dataâ€”things like Data
					Modeling, building Data Pipelines, and creating visuals that actually
					make sense to people.
				</p>
				<p>
					So that's what I do now! I help people and businesses make better
					decisions by:
				</p>
				<ul class="list-disc list-inside">
					<li class="my-2">
						Figuring out the right data to track based on what they want to
						achieve.
					</li>
					<li class="my-2">
						Pulling that data together from all the different places it lives.
					</li>
					<li class="my-2">
						Setting up smart and simple ways to collect data with tools like
						AppSheet and QField.
					</li>
					<li class="my-2">
						Turning raw data into insights and ideas for improvement with
						dashboards and reports.
					</li>
				</ul>
